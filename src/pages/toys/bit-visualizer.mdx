Hi 👋🏼, I'm Bit Visualizer!

<div class="not-prose">
  <OpacitySkeleton client:visible>
    <Number client:visible />
  </OpacitySkeleton>
</div>

You can click the boxes above to flip the bit or octal or hex value.
You can also directly change the number in the input box (or click the buttons below) on the right.
Have fun!
