#### How Many Bits per Pixel?
24 bits can be used to represent [True color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_(24-bit)).
> Typically 8 bits each of Red, Green, and Blue (8 bits per channel) which represents **a single pixel**. (_we are ignoring the alpha channel here_)

Here we are using the 6-digit version of [the RGB hexadecimal notations from W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hex-color).

> You can read the documentation from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color) as well.

Each channel (8-bit), `00-FF` can be notated in base-10 numbers between $0$ to $255$ too.
That allows you to use the numbers with [rgb()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb) via CSS.

#### Is True Color Sufficient?
So that's about how we store and read the data for the color.
> We used 24 bits, "True Color" here.

But this is not the end of the story and how we actually interpret and render colors is a lot more complex than that.

The color you see here is via [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) which has been the most popular way on the web.
